## 🌋 Volcanic Eruption Dashboard

A data-driven Tableau dashboard exploring global volcanic activity, dominant rock types, and eruption-related threats over the last 14,000 years.

## 📊 Project Overview

This project visualizes and analyzes volcanic eruptions worldwide, focusing on:
- Eruption counts by country
- Dominant volcanic rock types by country
- Distribution of rock types and volcano types outside the top 7 countries
- Countries with the highest volcanic activity
- Volcanic threats and real-world impacts

### 🌍 Data Source

The dataset was originally provided by the **Smithsonian Institution’s Global Volcanism Program**  
(https://volcano.si.edu/), and was accessed in a cleaned and curated format through a **Udemy course by Jed Guinto**

Special thanks to Jed Guinto for preparing the data in an analysis-ready format.

### 📌 Tools Used
- **Excel/CSV** – Data exploring 
- **Tableau** – Data visualization [Download here](https://www.tableau.com/products/public/download)

### 💡 Motivation

Volcanoes are powerful natural phenomena with widespread consequences. This dashboard aims to make volcanic data accessible, insightful, and actionable for both researchers and the general public.

### 🔍 Key Insights

- 49% of all recorded eruptions come from just 7 countries.
- Andesite and Basalt are the most common rock types in eruption zones.
- Stratovolcanoes dominate outside the top 7 eruption-prone nations.
- Understanding eruption patterns aids disaster preparedness and risk mitigation.

### Data Visualization with Tableau
To effectively present these insights, An interactive Tableau dashboard was developed to visualise:
