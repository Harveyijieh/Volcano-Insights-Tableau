# 🌋 Volcanic Eruption Dashboard

A data-driven Tableau dashboard exploring global volcanic activity, dominant rock types, and eruption-related threats over the last 14,000 years.

## 📊 Project Overview

This project visualizes and analyzes volcanic eruptions worldwide, focusing on:
- Eruption counts by country
- Dominant volcanic rock types by country
- Distribution of rock types and volcano types outside the top 7 countries
- Countries with the highest volcanic activity
- Volcanic threats and real-world impacts

## 🔍 Key Insights

- 49% of all recorded eruptions come from just 7 countries.
- Andesite and Basalt are the most common rock types in eruption zones.
- Stratovolcanoes dominate outside the top 7 eruption-prone nations.
- Understanding eruption patterns aids disaster preparedness and risk mitigation.

# HR Data Analysis

### Project Overview 
This project aims to analyse HR data using PostgreSQL for querying and Tableau for visualisation. The goal is to uncover insights related to employee attrition and workforce distribution. The analysis will help organizations make data-driven decisions to improve employee retention and satisfaction.

### Project Objectives

- Understand employee demographics and workforce distribution

- Determine attrition rates and key influencing factors

- Create visual representations of findings using Tableau

### Data Source
The dataset used for this project consists of 1,470 employee records and contains various HR attributes. 
The data was sourced from a popular HR analytics dataset, which includes information on employee demographics, job roles, education, attrition, and others.

### Tools
- Excel - for exploring the dataset

- Postgres - for querying and data analysis [Download here](https://www.postgresql.org/)

- Tableau - for visualisation and interactive dashboards [Download here](https://www.tableau.com/products/public/download)

- GitHub - for version control and project sharing [Sign Up](https://github.com/)

### Findings 

- Attrition Rate: The overall attrition rate in the dataset is approximately 16%.

- Department-Wise Attrition: The Sales and R&D departments have the highest attrition rates.

- Age Factor: Younger employees (below 30) show higher attrition compared to older employees.

These insights help HR teams focus on retention strategies by improving job satisfaction, adjusting travel policies, and addressing department-specific concerns.

### SQL Queries and Insights
#### Employee Gender Distribution
