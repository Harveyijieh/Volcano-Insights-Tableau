# 🌋 Volcanic Eruption Dashboard

A data-driven Tableau dashboard exploring global volcanic activity, dominant rock types, and eruption-related threats over the last 14,000 years.

## 📊 Project Overview

This project visualizes and analyzes volcanic eruptions worldwide, focusing on:
- Eruption counts by country
- Dominant volcanic rock types by country
- Distribution of rock types and volcano types outside the top 7 countries
- Countries with the highest volcanic activity
- Volcanic threats and real-world impacts


### 🌍 Data Source

The dataset was originally provided by the **Smithsonian Institution’s Global Volcanism Program**  
(https://volcano.si.edu/), and was accessed in a cleaned and curated format through a **Udemy course by Jed Guinto**.

Special thanks to Jed Guinto for preparing the data in an analysis-ready format.

## 🔍 Key Insights

- 49% of all recorded eruptions come from just 7 countries.
- Andesite and Basalt are the most common rock types in eruption zones.
- Stratovolcanoes dominate outside the top 7 eruption-prone nations.
- Understanding eruption patterns aids disaster preparedness and risk mitigation.

# Customer Churn and Retention Analysis
---

## Introduction
Customer churn is a critical challenge for businesses, impacting revenue and growth. This project leverages Power BI to analyze customer data, identify churn patterns, and propose actionable retention strategies. By visualizing key insights, we can understand customer behavior and take proactive measures to improve retention rates.

### Problem Statement
Many companies struggle with customer attrition, losing a percentage of their customer base over time. The goal of this analysis is to:
- Identify factors contributing to churn.
- Segment customers based on behaviors and demographics.
- Develop data-driven retention strategies.
- Utilize Power BI dashboards to visualize key trends and insights.

## Data Preparation and Analysis
### Data check
- Inspected data for duplicates and other inconsisitency.
- Created new calculated fields and measures. (e.g.,Churn rate, Retention rate, Total revenue etc).

### Key Questions Explored
- What is the overall churn rate?
- Are there specific age groups more likely to churn?
- How does monthly spending impact retention?
- Do customers on short-term contracts churn more frequently?
- Does customer support interaction impact churn?


### Data Visualization with Power BI
To effectively present these insights, An interactive Power BI dashboard was developed to visualise:
- Churn Rate Overview: Displays the total percentage of churned customers.
- Contract Type Analysis: Compares churn rates across different contract lengths.
- Monthly Charges and Churn: Correlation between customer spending and retention.
- Customer Support Interaction: Analyzing how support engagement impacts churn likelihood.

## Insights and Business Recommendations
### Insights
- Churn rate decreases as tenure increases. This means that customers tend to find more value over time.
- 76% of customers that opened technical tickets churned.
- Longer contracts engage more with the products than month to month customers.
- Short-term contract users (month-to-month plans) have the highest churn.
- 49.6% female engagement with multiple services.
- Customers who engage less with customer support tend to leave more often.
- Senior citizens engage more with the company products.
- Young customers (< 30 years) churn more frequently compared to older age groups.


### Recommendations
- Customers on monthly plans churn more often; Consider incentives for annual subscriptions.
- High spenders are more likely to churn; Introduce loyalty discounts or rewards.
- Customers who don't interact with support churn more; Implement proactive customer outreach.
- Offer discounts or bundled deals for customers at risk of churning.
- Improve customer engagement by personalized marketing and outreach programs.
- Early Tenure Engagement; since customers churn at the early stages, focus on the onboarding and engagement strategies.
- Technical support and Issue resolution; enhance the technical support process to ensure fast resolution of complains.
